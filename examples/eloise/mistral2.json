The Woodland Creatures dwelt on the fringes of their home, separate from one another based on physical traits or personalities. The Foxes lived on their charming hillsides, while the Rabbits had their gardens down below. The Elephants resided peacefully near the tranquil lake, and the Monkeys frolicked up in the tall, leafy canopies. The birds built their nests around the lake and among the trees, while the reptiles lived in the warmth near the forest's center.\n\nDespite this seemingly carefree arrangement, each creature harbored a deep sense of longing for companionship and unity among their Whistling Wood inhabitants. One season, a wise and aged Owl named Oliver observed the tenderness in the hearts of the creatures as they watched the blossoming spring flowers. Inspired by their tenderness, and with a gleam in his knowing eyes, Oliver decided to gather everyone for a talk.\n\nHe proposed an idea that would not only draw the diverse woodland creatures closer but would also celebrate their differences, creating a genuine sense of unity. So, the Animals' Unity Party, was announced, to be held when autumn's golden leaves floated gracefully down into the gentle autumn breeze.\n\nAs the day approached, the news of the Unity Party traveled like wildfire. The buzzing cicadas spread the word, while beavers built the grandest entrance and the industrious bees made the most exquisite honeyed desserts.\n\nThe party day arrived, and a remarkable sight unfolded. Creatures dressed vibrantly in colors reflective of their unique characteristics. The foxes wore their recognizable red fur, while the rabbits adorned their fine velvet coats. Elephants paraded proudly with their long, grey homes on their backs as monkeys swung and chattered. Birds sang enchanting tunes, and reptiles added rhythm with their mesmerizing slithering.\n\nWhen everyone gathered at the heart of the woods, Oliver, standing majestically on his perch",

His tiny paws were unsteady on the grass, and his legs felt like they were made of rubber. But Ollie was determined. He took a deep breath and stepped forward, watching with delight as the leaves danced in the wind beside him.\n\nAs he padded along, Ollie discovered new sights, smells, and textures with each step.

The cars whizzed past, their engines loud and intimidating. Ollie trembled, unsure of how to cross. But his human family saw his plight and called him over. With gentle encouragement, they guided him safely across the road, teaching him an important lesson.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Ollie made his way back to his family.

Once you recognize the trigger, try to anticipate it and be prepared to respond in a calm and controlled manner.\n2. Take a Time-Out: When you feel your anger escalating, take a break. Step away from the situation, take deep breaths, and practice relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation or deep breathing. This will help you calm down and think more clearly.\n3. Use Positive Self-Talk: Reframe your negative thoughts into positive ones. Instead of focusing on what you can't control, focus on what you can control. Use affirmations to boost your self-confidence and remind yourself that you have the power to manage your anger.\n4. Practice Empathy: Put yourself in the other person's shoes. Try to understand their perspective and see things from their point of view. This will help you respond in a more compassionate and understanding way.\n5. Learn Stress Management Techniques: Anger is often a response to stress. Learn healthy ways to manage stress, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep. Practicing relaxation techniques like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing can also help.\n6. Seek Professional Help: If your anger management problems are severe, consider seeking professional help. A therapist or counselor can provide you with the tools and techniques you need to manage your anger effectively.

Each one was beautifully adorned with different colors and patterns on their feathers that set them apart. And so, they spent their days waddling along the water, quacking contentedly to each other.\n\nBut amongst all these ducks, one little duckling stood out. His knee joints were unusually wobbly, and he couldn\u2019t keep up with the others. He tried his best to run alongside his siblings but would soon tire and limp away, leaving them behind. His talisman, instead of being a bright, bold pattern, was a knot of feathers in the shape of a swan \u2013 a gift passed down from his mother, he thought, indicating the potential for greatness.\n\nHowever, Duckling's peers didn't share the same sentiment. They made fun of his wobbly legs, taunted him for being slow, and cruelly called him Knock-Knees. Duckling felt sad and left out, longing to run and play with the others just like they did.\n\nOne day, as Duckling peered out at his siblings from the edge of the pond, he saw them attempt to climb the steep embankment to reach a tasty patch of clover. But they struggled, and one by one, they gave up, disheartened. Duckling, with his wobbly knees, could barely take a step, but he was determined. And so, he began to whisper to himself, repeating his mother's words, \"Your gifts, dear Duckling, are meant for a purpose.\"\n\nWith each painful step, the ground crumbled beneath his feet, but he continued, never wavering. Eventually, he reached the top and united the rest of his family with the luscious clover they had all been craving. The others marveled at his perseverance and, for the first time, appreciated his unique abilities.\n\nFrom that day on, Knock-Knees was revered as a hero, leading his family to new opportunities and discoveries.

    "orig_text": " This article offers some insight into techniques for managing anger and maintaining emotional control.\n\nAnger is a normal emotion, but when it becomes overwhelming, it can lead to destructive behavior. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to manage anger and regain emotional control:\n\n1. Recognize the early signs of anger: Be aware of the physical and emotional sensations that signal the onset of anger. These may include clenched jaw, tense muscles, increased heart rate, or feelings of frustration, annoyance, or rage.\n2. Take a deep breath: When you feel anger building up, take a deep breath through your nose and hold it for a few seconds. Release the breath slowly through your mouth. Repeat this process a few times to help calm your mind and body.\n3. Practice progressive muscle relaxation: This involves tensing and then releasing each muscle group in your body, starting from your toes and working your way up to your head. Doing this can help you relax and reduce stress.\n4. Use visualization techniques: Imagine yourself in a calming environment, such as a quiet beach or a peaceful forest. Visualize yourself calm and in control. This can help distract you from the source of your anger and help you relax.\n5. Practice positive self-talk: Instead of focusing on negative thoughts and emotions, try to replace them with positive and calming self-talk. For example, instead of thinking \"I'm so angry and I can't control it,\" tell yourself \"I can handle this situation and I will stay calm.\"\n6. Identify the source of your anger: Try to determine what is causing your anger. Is it a specific person or situation, or is it a deeper emotional issue? Once you have identified the cause, try to find a healthy way to address it, such as communicating effectively with the person or finding a healthy way to release your emotions.\n7. Learn to let go of grudges: Holding onto anger and resentment can be harmful to your emotional well-being. Try to forgive others and let go of any negative emotions. This can help you move on and prevent future anger issues.\n8. Practice regular physical activity: Regular exercise can help reduce stress and improve your overall emotional health. Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity most days of the week.\n9. Seek professional help: If",

A more pythonic way (although not using no loop) is using a filter function:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\neven_numbers = list(filter(lambda num: num % 2 == 0, numbers))\nprint(even_numbers)\n\n# Output:\n# [2, 4, 6, 8]\n```",

These may include clenched jaw or fists, increased heart rate, sweaty palms, frustration, anxiety, or a sense of being threatened.\n\n2. Take a time-out: When you feel your anger escalating, remove yourself from the situation as soon as possible. Find a calm and quiet place to be alone.\n\n3. Use calming techniques: Deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, or meditation can help you reduce your stress and anxiety levels.\n\n4. Challenge your thoughts: Examine the thoughts that lead to your anger. Are they realistic? Are they based on facts? Are they worth getting angry over? Instead, focus on finding solutions rather than dwelling on the problem.\n\n5. Practice forgiveness: Holding onto anger and grudges only harms you, not the other person. Forgiveness doesn't mean condoning harmful behavior, but it does mean letting go of the anger and moving on.\n\n6. Set healthy boundaries: Learn to say \"no\" assertively, and be clear about what behaviors or actions are not acceptable to you.\n\n7. Express your feelings in a healthy way: Use \"I\" statements to express how you feel, rather than blaming or criticizing others. Listen actively when someone else is speaking, and avoid interrupting or raising your voice.\n\n8. Seek support: Anger management is not an easy task, and it's okay to ask for help. Consider joining a support group, talking to a therapist, or confiding in trusted friends or family members.\n\n9. Practice kindness and compassion: Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and we all deserve compassion and understanding.

With a heavy heart, he decided to set things right.\n\nHe trudged through the storm to the river, knowing that the fishes were still there.

    "seed": 8012655,
    "orig_text": "\n\nAnger is a natural emotion, but when it becomes uncontrollable or harmful, it can lead to negative consequences for both the individual experiencing the anger and those around them. Here are some steps that can help someone with anger management problems manage their emotions and respond appropriately:\n\n1. Identify the triggers: The first step in managing anger is to identify the things or situations that tend to trigger angry responses. These triggers can be emotional, social, or situational, and may include things like stress, frustration, criticism, or feeling disrespected. Once the triggers have been identified, the individual can take steps to avoid them or develop strategies for responding differently when they do occur.\n2. Practice relaxation techniques: Learning relaxation techniques can help reduce feelings of stress and tension that can lead to anger. Techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization can be practiced regularly to help the individual feel more calm and in control.\n3. Use positive self-talk: Negative thought patterns can contribute to angry responses. Encourage the individual to practice positive self-talk, focusing on the positive aspects of a situation and reminding themselves that everyone makes mistakes and experiences frustration at times.\n4. Develop stress coping skills: Stress can make it more difficult to manage anger, so it's important for the individual to develop effective stress coping skills. These can include physical activities like exercise, hobbies, or creative pursuits. Encourage the individual to identify things that bring them joy and help them relax, and make time for these activities in their daily routine.\n5. Learn assertive communication skills: Assertiveness is an important skill for managing anger. Encourage the individual to learn how to express their thoughts and feelings in a respectful and clear way, without resorting to anger or aggression. This can help them address issues and resolve conflicts in a healthy way.\n6. Practice forgiveness: Holding grudges and dwelling on past anger or resentment can make it more difficult to manage current emotional responses. Encourage the individual to practice forgiveness, both for themselves and for others. This can help them release negative emotions and focus on the present moment and positive relationships.\n7. Seek support: Anger management can be a challenging process, and it's important for the individual to have a support system in place. Encourage them to seek",

If you've chosen Python, your solution will look like this:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(array):\n    for i in range(1, len(array)):\n        key = array[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and key < array[j]:\n            array[j + 1] = array[j]\n            j -= 1\n        array[j + 1] = key\n\n# Test the function\nnumbers = [4, 6, 11, 3, 15, 7]\ninsertion_sort(numbers)\nprint(numbers)  # Output: [3, 4, 6, 7, 11, 15]\n```\n\nThe Python approach uses the following steps:\n\n1. Iterate through the array, starting from the second element.\n2. Set the current index and the key as the current element.\n3. Compare the key with the previous elements and swap them if the key is smaller.\n4.

Seek Support: Anger management can be challenging, and it\u2019s okay to seek support from others. Consider talking to a therapist, joining a support group, or working with a coach to learn new ways to manage your anger.",

The base case for this recursion is when the length of the input sub-array is less than or equal to 1. This is an efficient case because an empty or single-element array is already sorted.\n3. Each recursive call halves the size of the input sub-array, meaning each recursive level deals with a sub-array that is roughly half the size of the previous level.\n4. The merge operation between two sorted sub-arrays takes O(n) time where n is the length of the sub-array.

To perform the traversal, it recursively calls the function for the left subtree, prints the current node, and then recursively calls the function for the right subtree. This function can be called with the root node of the binary tree as its argument to perform the traversal.\n\nThe main function where you call this recursive function could look like this:\n\n```c\nvoid createNode(int data, Node** node) {\n    *node = (Node*) malloc(sizeof(Node));\n    (*node)->data = data;\n    (*node)->left = NULL;\n    (*node)->right = NULL;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    Node *root;\n    createNode(5, &root);\n    createNode(3, &root->left);\n    createNode(7, &root->right);\n    createNode(2, &root->left->left);\n    createNode(4, &root->left->right);\n    createNode(6, &root->right->left);\n    createNode(8, &root->right->right);\n\n    printf(\"In-Order Traversal: \");\n    inOrderTraversal(root);\n}\n```\n\nThis creates a binary tree with nodes 5, 3, 7, 2, 4, 6, and 8.

Miko would spend his days swinging from tree to tree, chasing after butterflies, and having fun with his monkey friends. He was loved by the other animals for his quick wit and playful nature. However, there was one thing that made Miko stand out from the rest \u2013 he was very, very lazy.\n\nMiko would often laze around under the shade of tall trees, nibbling on ripe fruits, while the other animals worked hard to gather food, build shelter and create tool. Despite the warnings of his friends, Miko wouldn\u2019t budge from his lazy ways. He would just laugh and say, \u201cWhy should I work when the world is here to provide for me?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, wise old Krish, the crow, would watch Miko with great concern. He knew that one day, the season of fruits would pass, and Miko would not have enough food to sustain himself through the long winter months. He tried to tell Miko to change his ways, but Miko just shooed him away, saying he didn\u2019t need advice from a bird.\n\nThe days passed, and as the autumn leaves began to fall, the forest grew quieter. The trees were bare, and the once abundant fruits were nowhere to be found. The animals that had managed to store food began to hibernate while Miko was left all alone, shivering under the cold boughs of a large tree. He had little to eat and no shelter to protect him from the biting winds.\n\nOne cold, dark night, as Miko lay under the tree, shivering and hungry, he heard a familiar voice that echoed through the forest. It was Krish, the wise old crow.\n\n\u201cMiko, my friend, I have seen how you have suffered this winter. I have watched as you have wasted away under the warm sun, while I have worked hard and stored food for myself. It\u2019s time for you to learn the value of hard work.

    "orig_text": "\n\nAnger is a normal human emotion, but when it becomes overwhelming or leads to destructive behaviors, it can negatively impact your relationships, work, and overall well-being. If you're dealing with anger management issues, here are some steps you can take to help manage them:\n\n1. Identify the sources of your anger: Try to understand what triggers your anger. Is it a particular situation, person, or feeling? Once you identify the root cause, you can begin to find ways to manage your anger in those situations.\n2. Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, or yoga can help you relax and reduce stress. These techniques can help you calm down and respond to situations more effectively.\n3. Use positive self-talk: When you feel your anger building, try to talk to yourself in a positive and calming way. Use constructive statements like \"I can handle this situation,\" or \"This is just a temporary setback.\"\n4. Find healthy ways to express your anger: Instead of lashing out at others when you're angry, try to find healthier ways to express your emotions. This could include writing in a journal, going for a run, or practicing a hobby that you enjoy.\n5. Practice problem-solving: Instead ofreacting impulsively when you feel angry, take a step back and try to find a solution to the problem. This could involve speaking calmly and assertively with the person involved, or finding a way to address the issue in a constructive way.\n6. Seek support: Anger management can be challenging, and it's important to have a support network of friends, family, or a mental health professional who can help you learn healthy coping skills and provide encouragement and guidance. Don't be afraid to reach out for help if you need it.\n7. Take care of yourself: Eating well, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep can all help reduce stress and improve your mood. Make sure to prioritize self-care activities and make them a regular part of your daily routine.\n\nRemember, it takes time and effort to learn how to manage your anger effectively.

Reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook for 15 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and quinoa is tender.\n2. While the quinoa is cooking, prepare the vegetables: Chop the red and yellow bell peppers, red onion, and avocado.\n3. Warm up 1 tbsp of olive oil over medium heat in a frying pan. Add the chickpeas and season them with garlic powder, cumin, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook until the chickpeas have a nice golden crust, around 5 minutes. Set aside.\n4. In a small bowl, whisk together the juice of one lemon, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 tbsp of honey, and a pinch of salt.\n5. When the quinoa is done, fluff it with a fork and transfer it to a large serving bowl. Top it with the cooked chickpeas, chopped vegetables, Kalamata olives, chopped sun-dried tomatoes, and crumbled feta cheese.",

His coat was a charming mix of dark brown and white, forming an intriguing pattern that distinguished him among his peers.\n\nPeanut was recently weaned from his mother and taken in by the kind hearted baker, Mrs. Higgins. She doted on the little creature, feeding him the choicest morsels of her freshly baked goods. Peanut would waddle around the bakery, his small tail wagging with joy, as he marveled at the world around him.\n\nOne sunny morning, as Peanut nestled in his warm, cozy bed of straw, he heard the sound of running water. His nose twitched with curiosity as he followed the soothing melody. He discovered a charming brook, glistening in the golden sunlight, where the water gurgled and chattered delightfully.\n\nPeanut reluctantly left his comfortable bed behind, and with a zest of determination, took his first steps towards the riverbank. His tiny legs felt wobbly as he traversed the uneven terrain. Every now and then, he stumbled and tumbled, but he didn't give up. With each success, he grew more confident and carried on.\n\nAs he approached the riverbank, Peanut observed the vibrant life teeming in and around the water. Stars of colorful blooms adorned the banks, while dragonflies skimmed the surface, leaving ripples of joy. Pressed against the edge of the water, Peanut eagerly took his first laps, exulting in the cool, refreshing sensation.\n\nPeanut's world was filled with endless wonders and discoveries. There were textures to explore, people and animals to meet, and the endless fascination of his ever-evolving little body. Life was full of adventure for this curious little puppy, and each day was an opportunity to learn and love.",

    "orig_text": "\n\nHandling anger management problems can be challenging, but with the right strategies and techniques, it is possible to manage and reduce the intensity of anger. Here are some steps that can help someone with anger management issues:\n\n1. Recognize the signs of anger: The first step is to identify the earlier signs of anger before it escalates. Common signs of anger include tension, increased heart rate, feelings of frustration or annoyance, and a desire to lash out.\n2. Practice relaxation techniques: Learning relaxation techniques can help reduce the physiological and emotional responses that trigger anger. Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and meditation are some effective techniques.\n3. Use positive self-talk: Speaking to oneself in a positive and calming manner can help reduce the intensity of anger. Replace negative self-talk with positive affirmations.\n4. Identify triggers: Identify the things, situations, or people that trigger anger, and develop strategies for dealing with them. This may involve avoiding the trigger or learning new ways to respond to it.\n5. Use problem-solving skills: Instead of reacting angrily to a problem, use problem-solving skills to find a solution. This may involve brainstorming ideas, seeking assistance from others, or breaking the problem down into smaller components.\n6. Practice positive coping skills: Find healthy ways to cope with stress and frustration, such as exercise, hobbies, or engaging in relaxing activities.\n7. Seek support: Anger management can be challenging, and it may be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional, support group, or trusted friend or family member.\n8. Practice forgiveness: Holding onto anger and resentment only serves to make it worse. Practice forgiveness, both for yourself and for others, to reduce the intensity of anger and improve relationships.\n9. Use \u2018time-outs\u2019: If anger becomes overwhelming, take a time-out to calm down. This may involve taking a few deep breaths, engaging in a calming activity, or seeking support from a trusted friend.\n10. Develop a personalized anger management plan: Creating a personalized anger management plan involves identifying the strategies that work best for you and implementing them regularly. This may involve seeking professional help, joining a support group, or practicing relaxation techniques daily.",

It works by recursively dividing an unsorted list into two halves, calling itself for each recursive call on each half. The Base Case for this recursion is a list of length 1 because lists of length 1 are considered sorted. Once the base case is reached, two sorted lists are created (the left and right half of the unsorted list) and are merged back together using two pointers. The merged list is then recursively passed back up the call stack until the entire list is sorted.\n\n```python\ndef merge_sort(array):\n  # Base Case\n  if len(array) <= 1:\n    return array\n  \n  # Find the mid index of the array, and divide the array into left half and right half\n  mid = len(array) // 2\n  left = array[:mid]\n  right = array[mid:]\n\n  # Recursively sort both halves\n  left = merge_sort(left)\n  right = merge_sort(right)\n\n  # Merge the two halves back together\n  return merge(left, right)\n\ndef merge(left, right):\n  output = []\n\n  # Initialize pointers for both halves\n  i = 0\n  j = 0\n\n  # Continue merging elements until both halves are empty\n  while i < len(left) and j < len(right):\n    if left[i] < right[j]:\n      output.append(left[i])\n      i += 1\n    else:\n      output.append(right[j])\n      j += 1\n  \n  # Merge in remaining elements (if any)\n  output += left[i:]\n  output += right[j:]\n\n  return output\n```\n\nThis Merge Sort algorithm starts by checking the base case, which is when the length of the input array is less than or equal to 1.

They were all grateful for the bountiful blessings they received from nature every day. Among them lived two brothers, Wally and Buddy, Foxes. They were the closest of friends, and everyone loved them for their helpful nature.\n\nOne day, as they roamed around the valley, enjoying the warm sun, they discovered a poor, injured bird. Its wings had been damaged, and it could not fly. Wally felt very sad for the helpless bird and promised to help it. He and Buddy took turns carrying the bird to their den, where they built a cozy nest for it. They also gathered berries, nuts, and fruits and shared their own food with the bird.\n\nMeanwhile, up on a hill, there lived an ungrateful Goat named Gus.

    "orig_text": " If someone has anger management problems and they're feeling angry, here are some steps they can take to help manage their emotions and respond in a healthy way:\n\n1. Recognize the signs: The first step in managing anger is recognizing the signs that it's starting to build up. Some common physical signs of anger include clenched jaws, tight muscles, increased heart rate, and sweating. Emotional signs can include irritability, frustration, and a feeling of being out of control.\n2. Take a time-out: When you feel your anger starting to build up, take a break. Step away from the situation, go for a walk, or find a quiet place to sit and breathe. Use this time to reflect on why you're feeling angry and what you can do to calm down.\n3. Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization are all effective techniques for reducing stress and anger. Deep breathing involves taking slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and then relaxing each muscle group in your body. Visualization involves imagining yourself in a calm, peaceful place.\n4. Use positive self-talk: Instead of thinking negative thoughts about yourself or the situation, try using positive self-talk. This can involve reminding yourself that everyone makes mistakes, that the situation is temporary, or that you have the ability to overcome it.\n5. Identify triggers: Identifying the things that trigger your anger can help you prepare for and respond to them in a healthy way. Once you've identified your triggers, you can develop coping strategies to help you manage your emotions.\n6. Use problem-solving skills: Instead of reacting impulsively when you're angry, use problem-solving skills to find a solution to the underlying issue. This can involve asking yourself what you can do to change the situation, what resources you have available to help you, and what the potential consequences of different actions might be.\n7. Practice forgiveness: If you're holding onto anger towards someone else, practicing forgiveness can help you let go of negative emotions and feel more peaceful. This doesn't mean ignoring or excusing harmful behavior, but rather acknowledging that holding onto anger only hurts yourself.\n8. Seek support: If you're struggling with anger management,",

    "orig_text": ". Nothing fancy, just a simple bubble sort algorithm, and explain the thought process behind it.\n\nLet's write a simple bubble sort algorithm in Python. Bubble sort is a basic comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass is repeated until no more swaps are needed, indicating the list is sorted.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Use a flag to indicate whether any swap has been made in the inner loop\n        swapped = False\n\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n\n            # If the element found is greater than the next element swap them\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n                swapped = True\n\n        # If no two elements were swapped, then the list is already sorted\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n```\n\nLet's break down the code step by step:\n\n1. We define a function `bubble_sort` that takes an array as an argument.\n\n2. First, we calculate the length `n` of the array, which will be used in some loops' limits.\n\n3. The outer `for` loop (`for i in range(n)`) runs `n` times through the array.\n\n4. Inside this outer `for` loop, we define a boolean variable `swapped` which initially is set to False. This variable will keep track of whether any swap has been made during the current pass of the outer `for` loop. In other words, when we finish a complete pass where no element is swapped, we know, the array is already sorted.\n\n5. The inner `for` loop (`for j in range(0, n-i-1)`) runs `n-i` times for each pass of the outer `for` loop.\n\n6. Inside this inner loop, we use an `if` statement to compare each pair of adjacent elements and swap them if they are in",

    "seed": 1021797,
    "orig_text": " Here's a simple yet effective anger management technique:\n\n1. Recognize the signs: The first step is to identify the early warning signs of anger building up. It could be physical sensations like a racing heart, clenched fists, or tightness in your chest. Emotional signs might include irritability, frustration, or feelings of being threatened.\n\n2. Take a time out: When you begin to feel angry, give yourself permission to take a break. This might mean stepping away from the situation, finding a quiet place to sit, or engaging in a calming activity like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation.\n\n3. Reframe your thoughts: Challenge negative thoughts that fuel your anger. Ask yourself if they are based on facts or assumptions. Try to reframe these thoughts in a more positive and realistic way.\n\n4. Practice relaxation techniques: Use relaxation exercises to help reduce tension and calm your mind. Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization can all be effective ways to manage anger.\n\n5. Use calming affirmations: Repeat calming affirmations to yourself when you feel anger starting to build up. Phrases like \"I am calm and in control,\" \"This too shall pass,\" or \"I choose peace\" can help you stay centered and focused.\n\n6. Engage in physical activity: Regular exercise can help reduce stress and improve mood. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity most days of the week.\n\n7. Stay present: Try to stay focused on the present moment rather than dwelling on past grievances or future worries. When you find yourself getting angry, bring your attention back to the here and now.\n\n8. Practice forgiveness: Holding onto anger and resentment can be harmful to both yourself and others. Try to practice forgiveness, even if it's not easy. This doesn't mean condoning harmful behavior, but rather letting go of the emotional charge that comes with anger.\n\n9. Seek support: Anger management can be challenging, and it's important to have a supportive network of friends, family, or a mental health professional to turn to when needed. Don't hesitate to reach out for help if you feel overwhelmed or struggling to manage your anger effectively.",

Summit was known for his slowness and patience, and Flash was celebrated for his speed and agility. They were neighbors and lived in nearby habitats, with Summit residing in a cozy little burrow and Flash in a sprawling rabbit warren.\n\nSummit, being a thoughtful creature, spent his days pondering and improving his shell garden. He\u2019d painstakingly collect and arrange colorful pebbles, smooth leaves, and pretty flowers around his burrow. He spent hours ensuring the garden was perfect, carefully examining each detail.\n\nMeanwhile, Flash would spend his days darting across the forest, leaping through meadows and racing amongst the trees. He exuded confidence in his abilities and loved displaying his skills to all.\n\nOne sunny day, Summit emerged from his burrow and was admiring his shelter's beauty when Flash came bounding by with a cluster of ripe strawberries in his paws. Flash snatched a strawberry, took a bite and then, in a boastful voice, exclaimed, \"Summit, I've just come from the strawberry patch! I collected these berries in a flash. You could never keep up with me.\"\n\nSummit, with a gentle smile and a touch of sadness in his voice, replied, \"Yes, Flash, you are indeed swift and talented. But remember dear friend, it\u2019s not always about being the fastest. There's great beauty and value in taking your time to savor life's simple pleasures, just as I do with my beloved garden.\"\n\nFlash, surprised, contemplated Summit's words for a moment and then, curious, asked, \"Could you teach me how to enjoy life more slowly, Summit? I think I've grown tired of constantly racing.\"\n\nSummit, delighted, agreed and spent the following days with Flash, sharing his wisdom and introducing him to the slower, more deliberate joys of life.

Everyone has unique triggers, but common signs of anger include increased heart rate, muscle tension, feeling hot or cold, clenched jaw, or deep, rapid breathing.\n\n2. Take a time-out: When you feel yourself getting angry, take a time-out. This can be as simple as taking a deep breath, counting to ten, or taking a short walk. Use this time to calm down and collect your thoughts.\n\n3. Identify your emotional triggers: Try to identify the situations or people that make you angry. Once you know what triggers your anger, you can take steps to avoid or cope with those situations.\n\n4. Challenge your thoughts: Anger can be fueled by negative thoughts and assumptions. Try to challenge these thoughts by asking yourself if they are really true, and if there is another way to view the situation.\n\n5. Practice relaxation techniques: Relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation, can help you reduce stress and manage anger.\n\n6. Express yourself in a healthy way: It's important to find healthy ways to express anger, such as talking about your feelings with someone you trust, writing in a journal, or engaging in a physical activity like running or lifting weights. Avoid using unhealthy coping mechanisms like drinking alcohol, using drugs, or physically harming yourself or others.\n\n7.

They were the best of friends and spent their days playing, exploring, and sharing stories.\n\nHowever, as they grew older, Hoppy became obsessed with the idea of accumulating riches. He believed that having a stash of gold and precious gems would bring him happiness. To achieve this, Hoppy could not work hard enough, hoarding every piece of treasure he could find in the forest.\n\nMeanwhile, Turbo, content with his simple life, focused his energy on being helpful to his forest friends. Every day, he tended to the elderly, shared his wisdom with the young, and took it upon himself to ensure that the forest creatures had enough food during harsh winters.\n\nOne fine day, while Hoppy was basking in his meager fortune, he heard of a legendary gemstone, which the Mythical Phoenix guarded. Desiring unlimited wealth, Hoppy embarked on a perilous journey to acquire this gemstone.\n\nAt the beginning, everything went smoothly, as Hoppy relied on his agility and quick wit to evade various obstacles. However, his progress was disrupted when he reached the edge of a deep ravine. Overwhelmed with fear, he could not leap across it. He remembered Turbo\u2019s words of wisdom: \"A gentle soul gathers riches in ways that nurture and strengthen those around, leaving no one behind.\"\n\nBut Hoppy was not listening. Instead, he became more determined to claim the legendary gemstone for himself. He began to hoard the resources he required to cross the ravine, depriving his fellow forest creatures of food, water, and shelter to fuel his obsession.\n\nNews of Hoppy\u2019s selfishness spread throughout the forest, and soon the creatures began to band together in protest. Turbo, who had heard of Hoppy\u2019s greed, took it upon himself to steer Hoppy back onto the right path. Hoppy, shocked by the unity of the forest creatures, was forced to reconsider his actions and learn from his past mistakes.\n\nInspired by",

They had been a couple for three long years, and their love had grown only stronger with time.\n\nBut unseen forces were at work, conspiring to shatter their beautiful world. Pierre, an officer in the French military, had been assigned to an important mission, and Marie, who worked as a spy for the French Resistance, knew the danger he was in. She had sworn to protect him, but fate had other plans.\n\nOne fateful night, as Pierre set out on his mission, Marie received a message from the Resistance, urging her to take action. She was given a description of a German officer, and the location of a rendezvous where she would find him. The message was clear - Pierre was a plant, a German spy, and their love had been a sham.\n\nThe betrayal hit Marie like a ton of bricks. She was torn between her loyalty to the Resistance and her love for Pierre. The thought of him being a traitor to their country and to her was unbearable.

    "orig_text": " Anger is a natural emotion that everyone experiences at some point in their lives. However, if anger is causing problems in your relationships, work or daily life, it may be time to learn how to manage it effectively. Here are some steps you can take to help manage your anger:\n\n1. Identify your triggers: Understand what sets you off. Look for patterns in your anger outbursts, such as specific people, situations or emotions. Once you've identified your triggers, you can start to avoid them or prepare yourself for handling them.\n\n2. Practice relaxation techniques: When you start feeling irritated or angry, use techniques to calm your body and mind. Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation or visualization can help you relax and release tension.\n\n3. Use positive self-talk: Instead of thinking negative thoughts about yourself or the situation, challenge your thinking with positive messages. Focus on what you can control and let go of things you can't.\n\n4. Take a time-out: When you feel anger building up, take a break from the situation. Go for a walk, listen to calming music or do something that helps you relax. Taking a time-out can help you regain control of your emotions and respond in a more productive way.\n\n5. Express yourself assertively: Instead of exploding in anger, learn to express your feelings in a healthy way. Use \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements, and focus on how you feel rather than blaming others.\n\n6. Seek support: If anger management is a chronic problem for you, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. Therapy can provide you with the tools and support you need to manage your anger and improve your relationships.",

    "orig_text": " Anger is a normal emotion, but when it becomes excessive or uncontrollable, it can lead to negative consequences. Here are some steps someone with anger management problems can take to handle their anger:\n\n1. Recognize the signs: Being aware of the early warning signs of anger can help prevent it from escalating. Common signs include feeling your heart rate increase, muscle tension, and a feeling of heat in your face or chest.\n2. Take a break: When you feel anger building up, take a break from the situation. Go for a walk, do some deep breathing exercises, or engage in a calming activity to help cool down.\n3. Use positive self-talk: Challenge negative thoughts or self-talk that can fuel anger. Instead, focus on positive and calming self-talk that can help you stay in control.\n4. Identify triggers: Keep a log of situations, people, or things that make you angry. Once you have identified your triggers, you can take steps to avoid them or learn strategies to cope with them.\n5. Use relaxation techniques: Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization can help you calm down and reduce feelings of anger.\n6. Use assertive communication: Expressing your feelings and needs assertively can help minimize misunderstandings and conflicts that can lead to anger. Practice using \"I\" statements to express your feelings instead of blaming or attacking others.\n7. Seek support: Share your struggles with trusted friends, family members, or a mental health professional. Having a support network can help you stay accountable and provide valuable feedback and advice.\n\nRemember, anger is a normal emotion, and everyone experiences it from time to time. However, if you find yourself frequently losing control of your anger or experiencing negative consequences, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in anger management.",

Go for a walk, do some deep breathing exercises, or engage in a calming activity to help cool down.\n3. Use positive self-talk: Challenge negative thoughts or self-talk that can fuel anger. Instead, focus on positive and calming self-talk that can help you stay in control.\n4. Identify triggers: Keep a log of situations, people, or things that make you angry. Once you have identified your triggers, you can take steps to avoid them or learn strategies to cope with them.\n5. Use relaxation techniques: Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization can help you calm down and reduce feelings of anger.\n6. Use assertive communication: Expressing your feelings and needs assertively can help minimize misunderstandings and conflicts that can lead to anger. Practice using \"I\" statements to express your feelings instead of blaming or attacking others.\n7. Seek support: Share your struggles with trusted friends, family members, or a mental health professional. Having a support network can help you stay accountable and provide valuable feedback and advice.",

He had a peculiar feature that made him charming and comical among the other animals - a cross on his lips. They would often say he had a perpetual smile, as if he had a secret, and was always up to something fun.\n\nNow, in the same forest lived a group of rabbits. They were quick and clever creatures and lived in a well-hidden burrow at the base of an old oak tree. The fox, recognizing their value as food, would spend hours trying to figure out how to catch them. However, their burrow had a secret entrance, and the fox failed in all his attempts.\n\nOne day, frustrated and with a hungry stomach, the fox decided to trick the rabbits. He approached their burrow and with a charming, cross-mouthed grin, he said, \"Rabbits, I have a wonderful offer for you. I have prepared a delicious feast with the finest berries, nuts, and herbs. You will not find such a meal anywhere else. Please come out and join me for a delightful lunch. I promise, I won't bite!\"\n\nThe rabbits were clever and they knew the fox. They did not fall for his trick easily. After a moment of thought, the wisest rabbit tossed a carrot outside the burrow. \"Fox, we accept your invitation. Please bring us the first carrot, and we shall follow you to your feast.\"\n\nThe fox, thrilled with what he believed was the rabbits agreeing to come out, grabbed the carrot and trotted away, disappearing deep into the forest. The rabbits, knowing they had outsmarted the fox, returned to their burrow in peace.\n\nThe moral of this tale is: Be wary of those who offer tempting offers, especially when they have ulterior motives. Trust your instincts, and always think twice before acting impulsively. And remember, it is always a good idea to have a plan B!",

She was the talk of the village for her ethereal beauty and her gentle, kind soul. Her heart was as pure as the crystal clear waters of the river that ran through the village. Amelia was in love with a man named Edward, who lived in the neighboring village. He was a knight in the king's army, and he visited Amelia every chance he got to steal a kiss and whisper sweet nothings in her ear.\n\nOne fateful day, Amelia received a letter from Edward. He told her that he had been summoned to the king's court and would be away for months. He begged Amelia to wait for him and to remain faithful to him during his absence. Amelia, being the loyal and devoted lover that she was, vowed to do just that.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. Amelia grew more and more anxious with each passing day. She spent her days moping around the village, her nights torn between longing for Edward and worrying about his safety. One day, as Amelia was walking through the village square, she saw Edward, alive and well, laughing and joking with another woman.\n\nAmelia's heart shattered into a million pieces as she watched the two of them wrapped in each other's arms. Edward had betrayed her trust, her love, her very being. He had stolen her heart and then thrown it away, replacing it with another woman. Amelia was inconsolable, crushed beyond belief.\n\nThe news of Edward's betrayal spread like wildfire through the village. The once gentle and kind Amelia was a shell of her former self. She became a recluse, shying away from the villagers, her once radiant smile now replaced with sadness and heartache. Edward, on the other hand, didn't seem to care about the consequences of his actions. He continued to live his life as if nothing had happened, moving on to thenext conquest.\n\nBut Amelia's story doesn't end there. She took her broken heart and used it to forge a new path in life.

Growing bigger and stronger each day, the time came for Puff to explore the world outside his warm and safe haven.\n\nWith his heart full of excitement and anticipation, Puff followed Mr. Bakes as he made his daily deliveries to the villagers.

    "orig_text": "\n\nAnger is a natural emotion, but when it becomes excessive, uncontrollable, or harmful, it can lead to various negative consequences in our personal and professional lives. If you're struggling with anger management, here are some effective strategies to help you manage your anger and respond to anger-provoking situations in a healthy way:\n\n1. Recognize the signs of anger: Identify the physical and emotional signs of anger, such as increased heart rate, muscle tension, clenched jaws, fists, or sweating. Being aware of these signs can help you catch your anger early and take steps to manage it before it escalates.\n2. Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, or yoga can help calm your mind and body, reducing the intensity of your anger response. Make it a habit to incorporate these practices into your daily routine.\n3. Use the \"time out\" technique: When you feel anger building up, take a short break from the situation to cool down. Step away from the anger trigger, take a few deep breaths, and give yourself time to reflect before responding.\n4. Identify and challenge negative thoughts: Challenge your negative thoughts and assumptions by asking yourself if they are based on facts or evidence. Reframe negative thoughts into positive ones, focusing on solutions rather than dwelling on the problem.\n5. Express anger constructively: Instead of bottling up your anger or expressing it in hurtful ways, learn to express your anger constructively. Use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and focus on finding a positive solution to the problem.\n6. Develop healthy coping mechanisms: Replace unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as substance abuse or avoidance, with healthy ones, such as exercise, reading, or listening to music.\n7. Practice forgiveness: Holding grudges and harboring anger towards others can be detrimental to your own mental and emotional health. Practice forgiveness, letting go of the anger and focusing on moving forward.\n8. Seek support: Surround yourself with supportive people who can help you manage your anger and provide encouragement and guidance. Consider seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling, if your anger management issues are severe.",

Prepare the jalapeno and rose water infusion: Slice the jalapeno pepper into rounds and muddle 2-3 rounds in a cocktail shaker. Add a splash of rose water and let it sit for a minute to infuse the flavors.\n\n3. Add the liquid ingredients: Add tequila, orange juice, and grapefruit juice to the shaker.\n\n4. Shake: Fill the cocktail shaker with ice and shake vigorously for 20-30 seconds to dilute the ingredients and chill them.\n\n5. Strain: Use a fine-mesh strainer to pour the cocktail into the prepared glass. Discard the jalapeno slices.\n\n6. Add bitters: Dash the Citrus Sunset cocktail with a few drops of Angostura bitters.\n\n7. Garnish: Express the citrus oils from an orange twist over the cocktail and flick the twist into the glass.\n\n8.

In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for about 1 minute or until fragrant but not browned. Be careful not to burn the garlic, as it will give a bitter taste to the sauce.\n\n3. Pour in the canned crushed tomatoes, stirring to coat the garlic evenly. Bring the tomato sauce to a simmer.\n\n4. While the sauce simmers, wash and chop the fresh basil leaves. Set them aside.\n\n5. Once the tomato sauce has begun to simmer, gradually whisk in the heavy cream. Let the sauce cook for about 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.\n\n6. Remove the sauce from heat and stir in the fresh basil leaves. Allow the basil to wilt into the sauce.\n\n7. Toss the cooked spaghetti with the creamy tomato basil sauce until the noodles are evenly coated.\n\n8. Transfer the pasta to a large serving dish.

The tree was large and grand, with leaves that shimmered gold in the sunlight and branches that draped down, heavy with ripe, round pears. The branches hung so low that the little creatures that lived in the forest could easily reach them.\n\nOne sunny morning, as the forest woke up from its rest, the animals gathered around the pear tree, eager to taste the delicious fruit. Among them were Dan the deer, Buzzy the bee, and Chip the squirrel.\n\nThey all reached out for a pear, but a mischievous monkey named Moe snatched it away. \"This pear is mine!\" he cackled.\n\n\"Moe, that's not fair!\" cried Dan, his eyes filled with disappointment. \"Why don't we all take turns picking a pear?\"\n\n\"That's a good idea, Dan,\" agreed Chip and Buzzy. \"Let's form a line, and we'll each take a turn picking a pear.\"\n\nMoe grumbled but decided to join the line. They lined up, with Dan the deer leading the way, and Moe bringing up the rear. Each animal in turn picked a pear, with Dan ensuring that no one took too many. They picked pears until the tree was bare. Then they sat down to enjoy their delicious feast, sharing stories and laughter.\n\nSuddenly, a wise old owl flew above them, and his omniscient eyes shone brilliantly in the dusk. \"You have all done well today, my friends. The pear tree has provided for you, but it has also taught you a valuable lesson: Sharing is more precious than any one pear.\"\n\nThe animals looked at each other, understanding the meaning behind the owl's words. They had not only enjoyed the sweet taste of the pears but also the joy of working together and taking turns. From that day on, they continued to visit the pear tree, not only to enjoy its delicious fruit but to remind themselves of the beautiful lesson it had taught them.\n\nAnd they lived happily and harmoniously in the forest ever after.\n\n-- The End --",

    "seed": 8001856,
    "orig_text": "\n\nHandling anger management issues is not an easy task, but with patience, practice, and the right strategies, you can learn to control your emotions and respond to situations in healthier ways. Here are some steps to help you manage your anger:\n\n1. Identify your anger triggers: Be aware of the things, people, or situations that tend to make you angry. Once you recognize your triggers, you can start to develop coping mechanisms to deal with them.\n2. Practice relaxation techniques: When you feel angry, your body goes into a state of tension. Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation can help you calm down and reduce physical symptoms of anger.\n3. Use positive self-talk: When you're feeling angry, it's important to reframe negative thoughts and replace them with positive ones. Instead of focusing on the things that are making you angry, focus on what you can do to improve the situation.\n4. Take a time-out: When you feel yourself getting angry, take a break from the situation. Go for a walk, get some fresh air, or engage in an activity that you enjoy. Taking a time-out can help you clear your mind and reduce your emotional response.\n5. Use assertive communication: Assertive communication is a healthy way to express your feelings and needs without being confrontational or aggressive. Practice using \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements, and focus on finding a solution that works for both parties.\n6. Practice forgiveness: Holding onto anger and resentment can be damaging to your mental and emotional health. Practice forgiveness, even if the other person doesn't seem to deserve it. Forgiveness doesn't mean condoning harmful behavior, but rather releasing the anger and focusing on moving forward.\n7. Seek support: Anger management can be challenging, and it's important to have a support system in place. Consider joining a support group, working with a therapist, or talking to trusted friends or family members about your feelings. Remember that you're not alone, and there are resources available to help you manage your anger in healthy ways.",

Your code should return an integer or a float representing that temperature converted to Fahrenheit.\n\nExample: `celsius_to_fahrenheit(20)` should return `68.0`\n\nHere's my submission:\n\n```python\ndef celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit\n\n    Args:\n        celsius (float or int): temperature in Celsius\n\n    Returns:\n        float or int: the temperature in Fahrenheit\n\n    Example:\n        >>> celsius_to_fahrenheit(20)\n        68.0\n        >>> celsius_to_fahrenheit(100)\n        212.0\n    \"\"\"\n    return (celsius * 1.8) + 32\n```\n\nI chose to write this function in Python as it is a popular choice for scientific computing and data analysis. I added some docstrings to describe the function and demonstrate an example usage.\n\nTo run this code, simply copy and paste the text into a Python interpreter or IDE such as IDLE or Jupyter Notebook. The function can then be called with temperature values in Celsius as an argument. For example, `celsius_to_fahrenheit(20)` will return `68.0` and `celsius_to_fahrenheit(100)` will return `212.0`.\n\nPlease note that while this code follows standard Python conventions, the specific code may need to be adapted to other programming languages based on their syntax, usage, and required libraries.\n\nFor additional information and resources, I would recommend reading the Python documentation on [function definitions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions) and [docstrings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#help).",
